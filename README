Badly programmed script to get your amazon orders into a sqlite3 database and draw a graph of your monthly outgoing.
Works only with amazon.de at the moment.

Usage:

- copy .moneywaste-example to you homedir as .moneywaste
- create sqlite3 database named `moneywaste` and import table from `moneywaste.sql`
- run `moneywaste.rb startyear endyear`
- you can also run the data collecting task and draw taks seperatly:
  - `moneywaste.rb startyear endyear data`
  - `moneywaste.rb startyear endyear draw`
- example: `moneywaste.rb 2011 2012`


Todos:

- add error handling
- add configuration options for login-url, order-url and graph-filename
- change script to work with other amazon sites (.com, .co.uk, ...)
- learn to write good code
- improve code quality
